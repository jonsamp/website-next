              Originally from Kansas, I started post-college life as a
              herpetology researcher (
              <em>
                I have a wild story where I had ~100 snakes in my car at once.
                Ask me!
              </em>
              ). At the same time, I was interested in higher education. I found
              a job as an admissions counselor and proceeded to spend a year
              driving hundreds of miles around rural Kansas while talking to
              high schoolers and their parents about education.{" "}

              Then I moved to Chicago, taught myself Ruby on Rails, and was
              incredibly lucky to find a job as a JavaScript developer. While I
              didn't know JavaScript, they took a chance on me and I studied
              JavaScript every day on the train. I eventually wrote a whole{" "}

                course on JavaScript

              and the majority of{" "}

                another course on TypeScript
              </a>
              . I still think about JavaScript every day (Isn't it so
              wonderful?).{" "}

              Finally, I moved to Brooklyn, New York City. I have a Shiba Inu
              named Nikko and an Orange Tabby named Proxie. I'm lucky to be the
