            ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a software developer at{" "}
            <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a> in New York City, where I work on
            frontend and design projects. I love creating quality user
            experiences with JavaScript, React Native, and Expo. You can find me
            on <a href="https://github.com/jonsamp">GitHub</a>,{" "}

            <a href="https://twitter.com/jonsamp">Twitter</a>. Also, there's a
            list of my side-projects and packages below. Thanks for stopping by!{" "}

              Originally from Kansas, I started post-college life as a
              herpetology researcher (
              <em>
                I have a wild story where I had ~100 snakes in my car at once.
                Ask me!
              </em>
              ). At the same time, I was interested in higher education. I found
              a job as an admissions counselor and proceeded to spend a year
              driving hundreds of miles around rural Kansas while talking to
              high schoolers and their parents about education.{" "}
              {bioIndex === 1 && (
                <a onClick={() => setBioIndex(2)}>
                  <em>More...</em>

          {bioIndex >= 2 && (
            <p>
              Then I moved to Chicago, taught myself Ruby on Rails, and was
              incredibly lucky to find a job as a developer... as a JavaScript
              developer. While I didn't know JavaScript, they took a chance on
              me and I studied JavaScript every day on the train. I eventually
              wrote a whole{" "}
              <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">
                course on JavaScript
              </a>
              . I still think about JavaScript every day (Isn't it so
              wonderful?).{" "}
              {bioIndex === 2 && (
                <a onClick={() => setBioIndex(3)}>
                  <em>More...</em>

              Finally, I moved to New York City. Specifically Brooklyn. I have a
              Shiba Inu named Nikko (she has a{" "}
